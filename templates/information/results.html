                                    examination will take priority in the reporting stage.
                                    Our plain-film emergency reporting time for between the hours of 9am and 4pm is 1
                                    hour, however your referring emergency doctor will have experience
                                    of diagnosing a range of pathologies via x-ray.</li>
                                <li>Our reporting time for GP plain-film referrals is 7-10 days for orthopaedic images,
                                    and 10-14 days for all other images and pediatrics (under 16s).</li>
                                <li>If you have been referred from an outpatient department for plain-film images, these
                                    images will not be reported by our in-house reporters, instead these will
                                    be reviewed and commented on by your own consultant.</li>

                                    We have radiologists on site between the hours of 9am and 5pm to report on any
                                    emergency CT scans, and have access to radiologists out-of-hours

                                    these scans is usually within 2 weeks, however if you have
                                    found you have waited longer, please contact your referring physician and they can
                                    follow up with the radiology department.

                            Usually if you have been referred via emergency medicine or urgent care, you will get the
                            results on the day (before you go home) from the person
                            that requested the examination (usually the doctor or nurse in A&E or urgent care), you will
                            not get the results from the member of staff who takes your
                            images.<br><br>
                            If you have been referred by your GP to plain-film x-ray for a suspected fracture of a bone,
                            you will get the results on the day from the member of staff that took your images, however
                            this can take
                            up to an hour, as we must prioritise urgent cases. If you have a confirmed fracture, we will
                            then escort you to urgent care to be assessed and treated.<br><br>
                            For outpatient referrals, if you are going back to the outpatient department after you have
                            visited x-ray, then the referring physician should discuss your
                            images with you (though this isn't always the case), if you aren't going back to the
                            outpatient department then you will usually get the results the next time you
                            see/speak to your referring physician which can sometimes be up to 4 weeks. <br><br>
                            For the majority of examinations, you will not be able to get the results on the day, it
                            takes extra training to be able to diagnose and read x-rays/scans which the
                            majority of radiology staff have not had.<br><br>
                            For routine GP referrals, your GP will give you the results of your examination.
